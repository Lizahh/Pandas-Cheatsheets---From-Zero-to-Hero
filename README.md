## What is Pandas library?
   
   The pandas Python package is designed to provide fast, flexible, and expressive data structures that make working with "relational" or "labeled" data easy and intuitive. It also aims to be the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.
   
## Main Features
   
   Some of the things that pandas does well are:
- Easy handling of missing data
- Size mutability
- Automatic and explicit data alignment
- Powerful, flexible group by functionality
- Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects
- Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets
- Intuitive merging and joining data sets
- Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets
- Hierarchical labeling of axes
- Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files, Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format
- Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging

## Getting Started

Anyone can forget how to make the dataframes, series, slicing, indexing, conditional selection or pivot tables or grouping by operations in pandas. This Pandas cheatsheet tries to provide basic reference for beginner and advanced developers, lower the entry barrier for newcomers and help veterans refresh the old tricks.
